Housing Data Analysis Project
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to housing, with the goal of applying unsupervised learning methods to gain insights about the data. Below are the key steps taken to analyze the data and answer several business-related questions.

Project Overview
In this project, we used a dataset called housing.xlsx to perform data analysis and explore relationships between different variables. The goal was to provide valuable insights that can help in understanding housing trends and categorizing different groups of housing based on specific features.

Key Steps and Analysis
Dataset Presentation:

We began by exploring the dataset to understand its dimensions and the types of variables present.

The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables, which we summarized for further analysis.

Visualizing the Data:

Various graphs were created to visualize relationships between categorical and numerical variables, as well as between different variables themselves.

Plots such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots were used for the visual exploration.

Correlation Table:

A correlation table was generated to assess the relationships between numerical variables and understand their dependencies.

Unsupervised Learning:

We applied an unsupervised learning model to classify the dataset into distinct groups based on their features.

Evaluation of the model was performed to ensure its effectiveness.

Insights from Clusters:

The groups identified by the model were analyzed to answer the following questions:

Which group has the highest proportion of male homeowners?

Which group has the poorest ecological performance?

Which group contains the most expensive homes?

Which group has the largest population?

Conclusion
This analysis provides a deeper understanding of the housing dataset, offering valuable insights into different housing categories based on various factors such as price, ecology, and ownership demographics.
